Hello, <br>I've interests in Machine Learning, Image Processing, NLPs, Time Forecasts, Big Data, Data Analysis etc. 
<br>I developed interest in Data during my Post Graduation days where I studied Economics and experienced the importance of Data. 

This curiosity pushed me further to explore this field, and in this process I discovered various facets of Data Science like Machine Learning, Deep Learning.

The Basic Idea that everything can be analysed if we have correct form and quantity of data fascinates me a lot. 
Currently I am in learning process and working daily to upskill myself to be a Data Scientist.
