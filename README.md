# Data Science Portfolio
These are various projects which I've performed to upskill my capabilities as a Data Scientist.<br>
Projects are spreadout on various different sections of Data Science, like Data Analysis, Data Exploration, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, NLP and Time Series Analysis. 


## Machine Learning
- [SpaceX Falcon 9 1st stage Landing Prediction](https://github.com/ayushs0911/IBM-Capstone-Project)
  - **Problem Statement** : SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of $165 million/-, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. 
  - **Tasks Performed:**
    - Data Collection : HTML Web scrapping from Wikipedia and Request to SpaceX API
    - Data Wrangling 
    - Exploratory Data Analysis : Connecting to IBM DB2 Database and Using SQL queries to explore the data. 
    - Data Visualization : Using Seaborn and Matplotlib library 
    - Algorithms : Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree. 
    - Hyper-Parameter Tuning : Using GridSearchCV to find the 'Best Parameters'
    - Decision Trees Performed Best | Accuracy : ~ 90%
- HR Department Case Study: [Employees Attrition Prediction](https://github.com/ayushs0911/Projects/blob/main/HR%20Department:%20Attrition%20Prediction.ipynb) <br>
